# vim-cpywrite

[![Build Status][travis-badge]][travis-builds]

Generate copyright headers for any open source license

<img src=".github/img/nvim_043_ver_020.gif" alt="nvim-043-linux-demo" width="800"/>

## Description

Mostly written in CPython, this (neo)vim plugin fetches the license of your choice directly from the [SPDX License List](https://github.com/spdx/license-list-xml). If the XML response contains a standard header, it's inserted at the top of the current buffer with your copyright info.

When no standard header is provided, you can either insert a brief license acknowledgement, or the full license text. (See the `g:cpywrite_verbatim_mode` option [below](#quick-reference).)

This plugin learns your name and email by invoking `git`. If that fails, the copyright line will contain your OS user and host names.


## Highlights

- Python bindings compatible with python 2.7.x or 3.4+, depending on your platform and (neo)vim version, of course
- Choose from 380 licenses (press `<tab>` after the `CPYwriteDefaultLicense` or `:CPYwrite` command for suggestions)
- No dependency on other plugins. That said, neovim users will be grateful to have the [completeopt](https://neovim.io/doc/user/options.html#'completeopt') feature when tabbing through all the available licenses. Vim users may want to add `set wildmenu` to their `vimrc` file


## Quick Reference

### Commands
|   |   |
|:--|:--|
|`:CPYwrite [{spdx_short_name}]`|Fetches the license identified by `spdx_short_name` (without quotes) -- uses the current value of `g:cpywrite_default_license` when no argument is given -- supports `<tab>` completion |
|`:CPYwriteDefaultLicense [{spdx_short_name}]`|Sets `g:cpywrite_default_license` to the option license identified by `spdx_short_name` (without quotes) -- prints the default licence id when called with no argument -- supports `<tab>` completion|
|`:CPYwriteToggleMode`|Switches `g:cpywrite_verbatim_mode` on or off|
|`<Plug>(cpywrite)`|Does the same as calling `:CPYwrite` with no argument|

### Default mappings
|   |   |
|:--|:--|
|`{Normal}LH`|Maps to `<Plug>(cpywrite)`|

### Options
|   |   |
|:--|:--|
|`g:cpywrite_default_license`|The SPDX identifier of the license to be fetched by the `:CPYwrite` command.|
|`g:cpywrite_verbatim_mode`|When set to 1, the full license text will be requested -- only choose this when the license is no longer than 3-4 paragraphs (e.g. Unlicense, MIT, BSD 1- 2- 3-Clause, etc.)|


## Requirements

* Vim compiled with any one of the *+python[3]* or *+python[3]/dyn* options. See if you're supported by entering `vim --version | grep +python` at your terminal, or start `vim` and enter the `:version` command

* Neovim with the [**pynvim**](https://github.com/neovim/pynvim) module in your `$PYTHONPATH`. Start `nvim` and enter `:help provider-python` for more information


## Installation

If [**requests**](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) and (optionally) **pynvim** are not already in your `$PYTHONPATH`, install them:

    pip install --user -U requests
    pip install --user -U pynvim

#### As a vim package

If you have vim 8+, you can directly copy the plugin source tree to your [native package directory][vim-8-pkg-docs]. Learn more by typing `:help packages` into your `vim` command prompt. You should also read about [DIY plugin management](https://shapeshed.com/vim-packages).

Users of older vim versions can simulate native package loading with [vim-pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen#native-vim-package-management).

* Under `~/.vim` create the following directory tree: `pack/plugins/start`

> According to the [vim help topic][vim-8-pkg-docs] and [this tutorial][vim-pack-man], you can use any valid directory name in place of `plugins`,  but let's keep things simple!

* Clone the source: `git clone https://github.com/rdipardo/vim-cpywrite ~/.vim/pack/plugins/start/vim-cpywrite`

#### As a remote plugin

**Using [plug.vim](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)**

Edit your `~/.vimrc`, `~/.vim/vimrc`, or `~/.config/nvim/init.vim`:

```vim
call plug#begin()
"or:
"call plug#begin('~/path/to/your/plugin/directory/')

Plug 'rdipardo/vim-cpywrite'

call plug#end()
```

**Using [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim)**

Install Vundle:

    git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim

or

    git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.config/nvim/bundle/Vundle.vim

Edit your `~/.vimrc`, `~/.vim/vimrc`, or `~/.config/nvim/init.vim`:

```vim
set rtp+=~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
"or:
"set rtp+=~/.config/nvim/bundle/Vundle.vim

call vundle#begin()

Plugin 'rdipardo/vim-cpywrite'

call vundle#end()
```
